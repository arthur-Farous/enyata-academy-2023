Question 1
'let' and "const" when we are declaring variables in javascript.

The 'let' keyword is used for variables that can be reassigned.
However,variables that are declared by the "let" keyword can be re-assigned which of course allows variables for alteration. 


"const" creates "constant" variables that cannot be reassigned another value unless they are redeclared.
"let" creates variables tgat can be reassigned.

What distinquishes the 'let' and 'const' keywords from the var keyword are quiet are listed below;
 a.'var' declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while 'let' and 'const' are block scoped. 
 b.'var' variables can be reassigned while 'let' and 'const' variables can not.
 c. 'var' variables are declared using the var keyword while 'let' and 'const' variables are declared using the 'let' and 'const' keywords respectively.
 d'const' variables are immutable while let and var variables are not. 



Question 2
A variable can be used after defining it by referencing its variable name.

Question 3
A string can be declared by enclosing characters within single quotes ('') or double quotes ("").
Example;   
      let myString_a = "I am a good software developer";
      let myString_b = 'Thank you Enyata for this great opportunity';
      

Question 4
Yes,We can create strings by using both single quotes and double quotes interchangeably.  
However,it is advisable that we use one particular code style in your codes.

Question 5 
"9" is a string data type because of the quotes(" ").
 9 is a interger or  number data type.


Question 6
Declaration means introducing a new variable.This is normally done using the keywords 'var','let' or 'const'
Example;
 const myText = 'Fufu';
 whilst redeclaration means declaring a variable again in the same scope.
 Example; const myText = 'banku';

Assignment means assigning a value to a variable .This is normally done using the Assignment operator(=)
example ; 
    let grade = 9;
Whilst reassignment means assigning a new value to a variable that already holds a value.
example
 let grade = 9;
 let grade = 5;
